# landing-page

This is a project to practice my new CSS skills. I will be applying 'flexbox' algorithms to my HTML and CSS, to make a more presentable and eye-catching website. 

I aim to make this very practical - be able to imbed javascript easily to make the website responsive - and to use the knowledge that I have learnt from the past few exercises.
